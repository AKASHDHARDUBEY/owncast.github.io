If you have comments or suggestions, this is a great opportunity to talk as a group about your ideas. Alternatively, if you&amp;rsquo;re simply interested in what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to and want to quietly listen, you can do that too.
Join us on Thursday, August 19th at 1pm Pacific, 10pm CEST at meet.jit.si/owncast-discovery-meeting.
Looking forward to talking to you all soon!</description></item><item><title>0.0.8 is released!
