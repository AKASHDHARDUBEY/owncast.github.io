If you&amp;rsquo;re at all interested in what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to and want to quietly listen, or want to take the opportunity to jump in and be a larger part of the project, now is a great time to do that. Mark what date and time works best for you and we&amp;rsquo;ll get something on the calendar so we can all hang out.</description></item><item><title>Future updates for chat APIs that may impact 3rd party developers</title><link>/news/20210615-apis-future-releases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 10:33:06 -0700</pubDate><guid>/news/20210615-apis-future-releases/</guid><description>I wanted to highlight some changes that may impact those who use the Owncast chat APIs for building external tools.
The websocket used for chat within Owncast will no longer be generally externally available beginning with 0.0.8. Instead it is suggested you use Webhooks to get real-time updates of chat messages.
If you&amp;rsquo;re using the /api/chat endpoint to poll for chat messages please move to the already available /api/integrations/chat API that accepts an access token.</description></item></channel></rss>
