If this is something you\u0026rsquo;re not comfortable with you should consider using the \u003ccode\u003ev0.0.13\u003c/code\u003e tag to pull the latest stable release. However if you use the \u003ccode\u003edevelop\u003c/code\u003e branch for testing and local development we\u0026rsquo;d love if you\u0026rsquo;d continue to do so and helping us test the next release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"web-source\"\u003eWeb source\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeginning in v0.1.0 we will no longer be shipping the raw HTML, Javascript and CSS source files for the Owncast web interface. This means if you\u0026rsquo;ve been customizing these files you\u0026rsquo;ll need to work on migrating to the new alternative ways of customizing Owncast via the admin, or by pulling the source code and building it yourself with your customizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is an advanced warning that this is coming and you can start preparing for it now, or you can choose to hold off on updating to the v0.1.0 release until you\u0026rsquo;re ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf in testing you find there are things you used to be able to customize with Owncast that you cannot find a way to do any longer, please let us know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"docker-image\"\u003eDocker image\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are slowly changing the location of the Docker image.
