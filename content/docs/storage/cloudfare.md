Cloudflare R2 Object Storage is S3-compatible

[Cloudfare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/r2/) gives you the freedom to create the multi-cloud architectures you desire with an S3-compatible global object storage.

## Pricing

R2 provides zero-cost egress for stored objects â€” no matter your request rate

Here's a snapshot of usage and pricing for Cloudflare R2:

## Create an R2 Bucket

1. Before creating a bucket, you have to purchase the R2 plan in the Cloudflare dahboard [Purchase R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/pg-lp/r2/)
2. Click on R2 in the dashboard or go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/{ACCOUNT_ID}/r2
3. Enter your preferred unique bucket name > Click "Create bucket"

## Generate an S3 Auth Token

1. In **Account Home**, select R2
2. Select **Manage R2 API Tokens** on the right side of the dashboard
3. Select **Create API token**
4. Select the pencil icon or R2 Token text to edit your API token name.
5. Under Permissions, select **Edit: Allow edit access of all objects and List, Write, and Delete operations of all buckets**
6. Select **Create API Token**.
7. After your token has been successfully created, review your **Secret Access Key** and **Access Key ID values**.
   :warning: _You will not be able to access your Secret Access Key again after this step. Copy and record both values to avoid losing them._
8. The S3 endpoint is available via `https://{account_id}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` endpoint

## Set object lifecycle rules

R2 allows you to define object lifecycle rules. You need these to automatically delete old video fragments. Once these are streamed out they are no longer needed and just take up space.

1. Go to **Settings** in your preferred R2 bucket
2. Click **Add rule** in the Object lifecycle rules section
3. Give the new rule a name, for example "delete old video files"
4. Set the **Delete uploaded objects after:** value to 1 day

## Add CORS Policy

R2's CORS implementation currently takes the form of AWS S3's CORSRule.

R2 allows you to directly apply CORS policy in the Cloudflare dashboard.

- Go to **Settings** in your preferred R2 bucket

- Click **Edit CORS Policy** in the CORS Policy section

- Copy the JSON template below into the textbox

  {{< highlight json >}}
  {
  "AllowedOrigins": [
  "*"
  ],
  "AllowedMethods": [
  "GET"
  ],
  "AllowedHeaders": [],
  "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
  {{< / highlight >}}

You can also configure your AWS SDK for R2 in your favorite language [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/examples/)

## Enable Public Access

Cloudflare does not support [public access to R2 buckets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-access/public-buckets/) using the S3 api.

Public buckets can be set up in either one of two ways:

1. The first exposes your bucket as a custom domain under your control.
2. The second exposes your bucket as a Cloudflare-managed subdomain under https://r2.dev.

The easiest to use for testing purposes is a managed subdomain which can be setup as follows:

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard > select your account > R2
2. In R2, select the bucket you want to use for streaming
3. Go to **Settings**.
4. In Settings, go to **Bucket Accesss**.
5. Under Bucket Access, select **Allow Access**
6. After confirming your choice in the prompt, you can now access the bucket the bucket using the Public Bucket URL. `https://pub-<HASH-KEY>.r2.dev`

## Configure Owncast

Navigate to the "Storage" tab in the owncast admin dashboard.

- Endpoint: `https://{account_id}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`
- Access Key: The **access key** you created earlier
- Secret Key: The **secret key** you created earlier
- Bucket: The **name** of the R2 bucket you created, e.g. "owncast-stream-1"
- Region: `auto` When using the S3 API, the region for an R2 bucket is auto
- Serving Endpoint: URL you created when enabling public access to your R2 bucket, e.g. `"https://pub-<Hash-Key>.r2.dev"` if you are using managed subdomain. :warning: **_Must not end with slash_**
