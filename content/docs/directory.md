To help people discover streams by people using Owncast we have an optional Owncast directory you can add yourself to.

1. Visit the **"General"** settings in the admin.
1. Set the public URL to your Owncast instance that you want people to be linked to.
1. Set the **"About"** with a brief description of your stream.
1. Set the **tags** associated with the content you stream.
1. Mark if your content is _Not Safe For Work_ (nsfw).

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="This directory is operated as a complimentary service by the Owncast project to share people's streams. There is no obligation to list any specific server or topic. Any server can be removed at any time for any reason." >}}
