### Compatibility

In general Owncast is compatible with any software that uses `RTMP` to broadcast to a remote server.  `RTMP` is what all the major live streaming services use, so if you're currently using one of those it's likely that you can point your existing software at your Owncast instance instead.

However, we haven't tested with everything.  So if you're using something specific [we'd love to hear what software you're using and the results](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/new).  If you're finding yourself running into issues, we'd love to help troubleshoot.
