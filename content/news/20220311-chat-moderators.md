You can now add moderators without granting access to your Owncast admin.

In your admin Visit `Chat & Users` > `Users` to find the user you want to grant Moderator privileges. Bring up their details and you can add them as a moderator.

By default there are **no** moderators, so at the very least you might want to make yourself one.
However, you can always continue to moderate your chat via the admin, if you'd prefer.

## How it works

Once you become a moderator you can hover over a chat message and open a menu where you can remove a single message, or ban the user from the chat completely.
