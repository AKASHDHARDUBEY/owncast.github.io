Hacktoberfest is the annual event that encourages people to contribute to Open Source throughout October. This year Owncast wants to be more involved, so we're encouraging you to contribute to the project during October and get a Hacktoberfest and Owncast t-shirt! And it doesn't have to be just code and technical contributions, either! Documentation, media, tutorials, general advocacy and more are all welcome.

Learn more about the different types of contributions you can make to Owncast and how to get your t-shirt at [https://owncast.online/hacktoberfest](https://owncast.online/hacktoberfest).
