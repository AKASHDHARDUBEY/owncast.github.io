Owncast v0.0.11 has now gone live, and with it includes the long awaited features to bring Owncast to the Fediverse.

With these features people can follow your server and get alerted to when you go live. Additionally, as people engage with your live notifications outside of your server it will show up in your chat. This encourages people to share your stream and get a bit of recognition for doing so.

You can also compose posts within the Owncast admin to send to your followers, alerting people to your stream plans, or to remind followers that you're still streaming and to come visit, for example.

The full documentation for these new features can be found [here](/docs/social), and I look forward to seeing all of your Owncast servers joining the fediverse!
