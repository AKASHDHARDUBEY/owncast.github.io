I wanted to highlight some changes that may impact those who use the Owncast chat APIs for building external tools.

- The websocket used for chat within Owncast will no longer be generally externally available beginning with 0.0.8. Instead it is suggested you use [Webhooks](https://owncast.online/thirdparty/webhooks/) to get real-time updates of chat messages.

- If you're using the `/api/chat` endpoint to poll for chat messages please move to the already available [`/api/integrations/chat`](https://owncast.online/thirdparty/apis/) API that accepts an access token.

- `/api/integrations/chat/user` will be removed in favor of a new API to facilitate 3rd party bots and integrations to send chat messages identifying themselves as that specific 3rd party.

If you have a use case that doesnâ€™t fit [these and the other APIs](https://owncast.online/thirdparty/) please let us know and we may find a safe way to support the features you require.
