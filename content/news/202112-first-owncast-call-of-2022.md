We'll be getting together to chat about Owncast and you're invited.

If you're currently a user of Owncast, a person who's interested in being involved, or are just curious what the project is up to, we'd love to have you join us.

We'll be talking about upcoming features, releases, and sharing ideas together on how to make Owncast better.

To make sure people who want to attend can make it please [mark the date and time that works best for you](https://doodle.com/poll/95ud2raip7grurkg).

## Some topics of discussion this time around

1. The new ActivityPub-powered social features will be demoed.
1. The new inline chat moderation tools will be demoed.
1. Go over the testing required of the new features to be able to release them.
1. Talk about some of the outreach attempts to add missing skillets to the project.

I look forward to seeing you all in 2022 and building some really cool things with all of you!
