Owncast will have its next public call to discuss the current and future of the project. If you have comments or suggestions, this is a great opportunity to talk as a group about your ideas. Alternatively, if you're simply interested in what we've been up to and want to quietly listen, you can do that too.

Join us on Thursday, August 19th at [1pm Pacific, 10pm CEST](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/event?lid=12%2C8%2C5391959&h=12&sts=27155400&sln=22-23&a=show&euid=326725ad-e5a9-8294-c9a5-153724504b97) at [meet.jit.si/owncast-discovery-meeting](https://meet.jit.si/owncast-discovery-meeting).

Looking forward to talking to you all soon!
