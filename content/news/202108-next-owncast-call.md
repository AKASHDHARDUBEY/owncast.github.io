Owncast will have its next public call to discuss the current and future of the project. If you're at all interested in what we've been up to and want to quietly listen, or want to take the opportunity to jump in and be a larger part of the project, now is a great time to do that. [Mark what date and time works best for you](https://doodle.com/poll/cemfaaeywrtddmh3) and we'll get something on the calendar so we can all hang out.

Looking forward to talking to you all soon!
