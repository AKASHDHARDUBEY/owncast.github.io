On January 17th we'll be getting together to chat about Owncast and you're invited.  12PM Pacific time, but [find your local time here](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/event?lid=2964574%2C8%2C5101798&h=2964574&sts=27372960&sln=20-21&a=show&euid=8aefe30b-30a3-fe44-6988-28fabd665d42).

Join the call at https://meet.jit.si/owncast-discovery-meeting.

If you're currently a user of Owncast, a person who's interested in being involved, or are just curious what the project is up to, we'd love to have you join us. You're welcome to quietly listen, or be as involved as you like.

We'll be talking about upcoming features, releases, and sharing ideas together on how to make Owncast better.


## Some topics of discussion this time around

1. The new ActivityPub-powered social features will be demoed.
1. The new inline chat moderation tools will be demoed.
1. Go over the testing required of the new features to be able to release them.
1. Talk about some of the outreach attempts to add missing skill sets to the project.
1. Future of some features and development.

I look forward to seeing you all in 2022 and building some really cool things with all of you!
