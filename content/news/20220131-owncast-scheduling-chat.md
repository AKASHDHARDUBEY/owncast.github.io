We sat down to have a discussion about what scheduled live events could look like, and what features that would open up for streamers on Owncast. [We shared it](https://youtu.be/memUaz03Npg) so you can check it out on your own time.

[Stay tuned](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ4y3XLPKGg8vxVTUaGemDQ) for more videos where we discuss potential future initiatives within Owncast. And as always, we'd love your feedback so we can build the things that are most useful for all of you.
