    While nothing is set in stone, Owncast tries to set a relatively clear
    roadmap for future work and features. This enables the project to discuss
    things far in advance to make the best possible decisions as well as
    allowing Owncast users to know what types of updates they can expect.
  </p>
  <p>
    As time goes on planning for specific releases get more detailed, and it's
    very common for additional, smaller, releases to get slipped in between
    larger features to fix bugs and address feedback.
