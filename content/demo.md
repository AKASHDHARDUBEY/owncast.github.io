title: Owncast Demo Servers
---

Seeing is believing! We provide a public Owncast server for you to see how it works.

### Browse Owncast instances at [directory.owncast.online](http://directory.owncast.online/)

The directory allows streams to list themselves for discovery by potential viewers and the Owncast community. Operated as a complimentary service by Owncast, it lists servers that have [explicitly opted in](https://owncast.online/docs/directory/) to be public. There is no obligation to list any specific server or topic, and objectionable content can be removed at any time. 

You can browse the directory using compatible applications. Learn more about watching Owncast streams and [browsing the directory on other devices](https://owncast.online/docs/watching-on-tvs/).
