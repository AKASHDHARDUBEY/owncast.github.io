# Use cases

## One time events

In the era of COVID-19 everything has to go online, so live stream your conference, meeting, concert, wedding, birthday, etc.

Read about how [Matt Steele streamed his wedding](https://steele.blue/livestream-setup/) and [why](https://steele.blue/indieweb-wedding-livestream/).

If you have a conference or event with multiple people talking via Zoom, you can [even stream that](https://owncast.online/docs/broadcasting/#using-with-zoom) so not everyone has to be logged into a conferencing platform, they can just visit the web site.


## Content creators

Have your own website where your community can watch your live streams and you no longer have to worry about the arbitrary rules[^1] enforced on the mainstream streaming sites. Chat and custom emojis are supported so people can feel at home.


## Church services

Bring your service online and control how it's streamed.  Decide if you want to just embed the video into your existing site or use the included web interface.


## Movies with friends

Get your friends together online to watch a movie[^1]. With Owncast's chat feature, you can still make comments about how bad the film is.


## Internal Events

You can stream internal events like Company Townhall events on your own infrastructure without relying on external partners. This can also be useful, if your connection to the internet is bad, but the internal wiring is fine, like in schools. With Owncast, the stream never leaves your building or your VPN.


[^1]: Please note that you might still get in legal troubles if you host unlicensed material like music or movies that you should not stream. If in doubt, check with copyright lawyers in your jurisdiction.
