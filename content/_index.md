<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In 2020 the world changed when everyone become stuck in their homes, looking for creative outlets to share their art, skills and themselves from inside their bedroom.

This created an explosion of live streaming on Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Instagram, and Twitch.  These services provided everything they needed, an easy way to live stream to the world, and a chat for users to be a part of their community.

There deserves to be a better option for people. Something you could run yourself and get all the functionality of these services, where you could live stream to an audience and and allow them to take part in the chat, just like they've been used to on all the other services.  **There should be a independent, standalone _Twitch in a Box_.**

## Getting Started

The goal is to have a single service that you can run that works out of the box. **Visit the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/) to get up and running.**
