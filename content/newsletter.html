Like everything else Owncast-related, we only want to build things that are
useful to you. So if enough people sign up for an Owncast newsletter, we'll have
one!
<p>If not, no big deal.</p>

<p>
  We plan to send out a newsletter periodically with project updates and
  featured community content. We'll never spam you or sell your email address.
  You can unsubscribe at any time.
