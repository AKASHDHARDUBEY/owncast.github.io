# API Documentation

Owncast offers an API to integrate its services in other interfaces, like the [Owncast Admin Panel](https://github.com/owncast/owncast-admin).

## The latest API

You can checkout the API documentation with the latest development that matches the `master` branch of the [git repository](https://github.com/owncast/owncast).
Please mind that this version might be unstable as does not have the testing that Owncast releases endure.
