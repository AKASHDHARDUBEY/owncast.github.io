Owncast is a growing free and open source live video streaming and chat project available for those who have live streaming needs. This includes anything from corporate events, game streams, school events, musicians, wedding venues, churches, TV stations, and more.

With the number of streamers and viewers growing, and new features on the horizon, the project is looking to add a dedicated user experience designer to help us focus on the experience of streamers and viewers alike.

The volunteer role would be responsible for more structural issues such as understanding how best to add new features and improve overall flow, in addition to ongoing detailed improvements to the existing visual layout and design.

Some upcoming features you would be heavily involved with:

- Scheduled live streams
- Stream clips
- Mini-directories

We’re still young in our design goals and would love your experience to inform both the process and the pixels around building a cohesive product that people love to use.
