RTMP is what all the major live streaming services use, so if you&amp;rsquo;re currently using one of those it&amp;rsquo;s likely that you can point your existing software at your Owncast instance instead.
However, we haven&amp;rsquo;t tested with everything. So if you&amp;rsquo;re using something specific we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear what software you&amp;rsquo;re using and the results.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://owncast.online/docs/building/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/docs/building/</guid><description>Building from Source # Ensure you have the gcc compiler configured. Install the Go toolchain. Clone the repo. git clone https://github.com/gabek/owncast Follow the above Getting Started instructions, making sure ffmpeg exists and your config file is set. Make any configuration changes. go run main.go on the first run will download the required packages needed for the application to build. It will start running the same as in the above Usage instructions and you can point OBS to your localhost instance of it.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://owncast.online/docs/configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/docs/configuration/</guid><description>Configuration # The default config.yaml has a handful of values you can change. However, more can be customized if you need them to be. Some common changes to the config are:
Your site name, logo, description and external links. The stream key to gain access to broadcasting to your stream. The path to your specific ffmpeg executable. Video quality settings. S3 file storage. An example config file with additional features can be viewed below.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://owncast.online/docs/embed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/docs/embed/</guid><description>Embedding video # Owncast supports embedding your video stream directly into any other web site or source without having to setup a player.
The video-only URL to your stream content lives at: http://your.host/embed/video.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some example HTML you can use.
&amp;lt;iframe src=&amp;#34;http://your.host/embed/video&amp;#34; title=&amp;#34;Owncast&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;350px&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;550px&amp;#34; referrerpolicy=&amp;#34;origin&amp;#34; scrolling=&amp;#34;no&amp;#34; allowfullscreen&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt; Embedding video was first supported in Owncast 0.0.2. Embedding chat # Owncast supports embedding your chat directly into any other web site or source.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://owncast.online/docs/encoding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/docs/encoding/</guid><description>Tuning the video encoding # It&amp;rsquo;s hard to give specific settings that will give you the best quality and performance with Owncast because people have different servers and requirements. However, this document aims to outline what is being done to your content and the different knobs you can tweak to get the best output for your instance..
But first the basics.
How does an Owncast video stream work? # Owncast takes your source stream and converts it to short, individual video segments.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://owncast.online/docs/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/docs/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions # 1. Who is this for? # Owncast is for people who are live streamers, or who wants to host live streams for others. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;one to many&amp;rdquo; broadcast much like Twitch, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, etc.
2. Who or what is this not for? # Owncast is not for video conferencing or any use case where multiple people are wanting to see video of each other.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://owncast.online/docs/geoip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/docs/geoip/</guid><description>GeoIP Lookups # Owncast can display high-level geographic information about your current viewers if you enable GeoIP support in your instance.
We support the MaxMind GeoLite2 Database, and as long as you provide a free copy of the database it will be used. Perform the following in order to add this feature.

While crunching through video and serving it to viewers can be intensive from the computing side, you can get away with pretty meager resources on a simple setup. If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have a server to run it on you can get a Linode instance for $5/mo that runs it fine. If you worry that you&amp;rsquo;ll be maxing out the bandwidth or transfer limits allotted to you, then utilize S3 Storage very cheaply (or even free for a certain amount) to serve the files instead.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://owncast.online/docs/s3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/docs/s3/</guid><description>Owncast with S3 Providers # Instead of serving video directly from your personal server you can use a S3 compatible storage provider to offload the bandwidth and storage requirements elsewhere.
Choose your storage provider of choice. Yours not listed? File an issue and we&amp;rsquo;ll test and write up some documentation for it.

Here are some steps you can try taking to resolve this.
You may have too many quality variants defined in your configuration. Try limiting yourself to a single option, and go from there. Change to a faster encoder preset in your configuration.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://owncast.online/docs/website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/docs/website/</guid><description>Web site with video player and chat # Overview # Owncast includes a web interface for your video with built-in chat that is available once you start the server. It shows online/offline states, viewer counts, stream duration, your instance&amp;rsquo;s description, images, links and more. You can just start using it without making any changes and it&amp;rsquo;ll reflect whatever you put in the config file.
However, the web interface was specifically built to be editable by anybody comfortable tweaking a web page.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>http://owncast.online/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/contact/</guid><description>Contact # Gabe Kangas
